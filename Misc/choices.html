                    In general, the term "hacker" has been used in the public media, it generally refers to cyber criminals, <br>
                    however a hacker may be anybody who uses their understanding of computer and network to decompose        <br>
                    and circumvent security protocols on a system, phone, or network etc... regardless of their motives.     <br>

                    Colours are used as general categories to describe the wide range of hackers.<br>
                    <br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">
                        -White (Positive)<br>
                    </font>
                    A white hat is a person who is hired or recruited to carry out an assault with express authority and well defined parameters. <br>
                    White hats' job is to uncover, analyze, and evaluate vulnerabilities, exploits, and infections in specific targets.           <br>
                    The results of these expert engagements are immediately communicated to the target, allowing them to close any gaps and       <br>
                    improve their security status. White hats also were involved in the development of security methods and services on occasion. <br>
                    <br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">
                        -Black (Negative)<br>
                    </font>
                    Black hats, on the other hand, do significant purposeful harm and wealth at the expense of its targets. <br>
                    Through destructive, unlawful internet activity, they are responsible for directing attack patterns and <br>
                    conversely driving employment demand in the white-hat sector. What drives this eclectic collection of   <br>
                    black hats? Money, personal satisfaction, retribution, media attention, promotion of their ideas,       <br>
                    the quest of important data, and simply sheer fun are among the many motives and purposes that hackers  <br>
                    are drawn to.<br>
                    <br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">
                        -Grey (Neutral)<br>
                    </font>
                    Gray hats, as their name implies, have a more unclear meaning. Depending on your point of view, their   <br>
                    work may be considered as good or bad. The phrase "grey hat" is occasionally used to refer to those who <br>
                    disobey the law without intending to commit a crime. Cyber vandals who vandalise websites and rogue     <br>
                    security researchers who publicly reveal identified vulnerabilities without alerting or obtaining       <br>
                    authorisation from their targets may be included in this description.<br>

                    -Ethics of a hacker can be one of the benchmarks to tell if a hacker is good or bad.                 <br>
                    (What their motivation, permission and legality is)                                                  <br><br>
                    -An ethical hacker can assist a company in determining where the most important data is kept and how <br>
                    the best way to secure it. This process secures the collected data.                                  <br><br>
                    -Collaboration with a company to help reduce the risk of security breaches from black hat hackers.   <br>
                    This proves that this is work of a white hat hacker.                                                 <br><br>
                    -White hats are frequently called upon to imitate or recreate the attacks from the black hats.       <br>
                    Ethical hackers must have their attention on the evolving technologies, weaknesses, dangers, and     <br>
                    attackers in order to do this. Although with the best efforts, staying ahead of the game and         <br>
                    protecting against advances from complicated black-hat networks is an ongoing struggle for security  <br>
                    experts.<br><br>
                    -Many cybersecurity experts, researchers, and police agencies want to keep an eye on shady internet  <br>
                    hacking communities in order to learn about the latest attack patterns, tools, and danger environment.<br>
                    Regardless of the advantages of learning through direct contacts to the dark side, white hats must be<br>
                    aware of the delicate legal and ethical boundaries that exist in their job.<br><br>
