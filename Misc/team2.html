<main id="boxes">
<div id = "coloumn1">
	<p> > Customer data is a focus area all its own.From consumer behavior to predictive analytics, 
		companies regularly capture, store, and analyze large amounts of quantitative and qualitative 
		data on their consumer base every day. Some companies have built an entire business model around 
		consumer data, whether they're companies selling personal information to a third party or 
		creating targeted ads. Customer data is big business.</P></div>
		
<div id = "coloumn2">
	<p> >  Data privacy has made it to the U.S. in the form of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). 
		The CCPA is, in some ways, similar to GDPR regulation but differs in that it requires consumers to 
		opt out of data collection rather than putting the onus on service providers. It also names the 
		state as the entity to develop applicable data law rather than a company's internal decision-makers.

		Data privacy regulations are changing the way businesses capture, store, share and analyze consumer data. 
		Businesses that are so far untouched by data privacy regulations can expect to have a greater legal obligation 
		to protect consumers' data as more consumers demand privacy rights. Data collection by private companies, though,
		is unlikely to go away; it will merely change in form as businesses adapt to new laws and regulations.</p></div>
