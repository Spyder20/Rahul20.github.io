	<p> Hacking significantly affects the development of systems and networks. This is 
	    especially the case of systems and networks of organizations where sensitive or 
		confidential information are used on a regular basis. Organizations must find 
		solutions and measures to protect information technology assets. In this endeavor, 
		organizations can use ethical hacking. Ethical hacking is a hacking role that 
		business organizations can exploit for security purposes. Ethical hacking presents 
		advantages to increase the capabilities of organizations to protect their IT and 
		information assets. Ethical hacking sheds a positive light on hacking. Nonetheless, 
		any organization that implements ethical hacking must consider the potential negative 
		impacts and issues arising from the practice.</p></div>

<h3><b>Legal Risks of Ethical Hacking:</b></h3>
	
	<p>The legal risks of etchical hacking inculde lawsuits due to disclosure of personal
	   or confidental information.Such disclosure can lead to a legal battle involving 
	   the organization and the ethical hacker, it is very easy for ethical hacking to
	   result in a legal battle if it is not performed properly. It is also possible for
	   the ethical hacker to commit error to the point that the orginization's profitab-
	   -ility is negativley affected.</p>
	   
	<p>In such a case, the orginization could sue the eithical hacker for failing to per-
	   -form properly. The ethical hacker could be at legal risk if proper care and prec-
	   -autionare are not seriously taken. To address these legal issues, it is imperati-
	   -ve for the ethical hacker to always perform his job defensively to minimize compr-	
	   -mising the client's system or network.</p>

	<h3>Ethical Hacking Pros and Cons</h3>
	<p> The advantage of ethical hacking is that it supports business efforts to gain more 
	    comprehensive knowledge about the organization’s IT security. Through ethical hacking,
		the organization identifies security vulnerabilities and risks. This knowledge helps 
		improve organizational efforts to strengthen security measures.

		However, the main disadvantage of ethical hacking is that it presents risks of information 
		disclosure. As an outsider, the ethical hacker could intentionally or unintentionally 
		disclose the company’s confidential information to other parties.</p></div>
<div id = "coloumn4">
	<h3>Code of Ethics for Ethical Hackers:</h3>
	<p>1) Before performing any ethical hacking, ensure that you know and understand the
		  nature and characteristics for the client organization's business, system and 
		  network. This will guide you handling sensitive, confidental or proprietary 
		  infomation you might enounter during the ethcal hacking.</p>
	<p>	2) Before and during ethical hacking, determine the sensitivity or confidentiality 
		   of the information involved. This should ensure that you do not violate laws, 
		   rules and regulations in handling sensitive personal, financial or proprietary 
		   information.</p>
	<p> 3) During and after ethical hacking, maintain transparency with the client. 
		   Communicate all relevant information you found while ethically hacking the 
		   client’s system or network. Transparency ensures that the client knows what is 
		   going on. Transparency enables the client to take necessary actions for security 
		   of the system or network.</p>
	<p>	4) While performing ethical hacking, do not go beyond the limits set by the client. 
		   In ethical hacking, it is possible for you to have access beyond the target areas 
		   that the client signed up for. Stay within the target areas of the system or 
		   network specified in the work agreement. Do not go to other areas or components of 
		   the system or network that are not specified in the agreement. Minimize exposure 
		   of sensitive information. Increase your trustworthiness and reliability as an ethical 
		   hacker. Ensure the overall effectiveness of the ethical hacking activity.</p>
	<p>	5) After performing ethical hacking, never disclose client information to other parties. 
		   Ensure the protection of the client. Ethical hacking is done for the security of the 
		   client’s system or network. Disclosure of the client’s confidential information renders 
		   ethical hacking ineffective. Private information must be kept private, and confidential 
		   information must be kept confidential.</p></div>
