<p><b>Legal Risks of Ethical Hacking:</b></p>
	<p>The legal risks of etchical hacking inculde lawsuits due to disclosure of personal<br>
	   or confidental information.Such disclosure can lead to a legal battle involving <br>
	   the organization and the ethical hacker, it is very easy for ethical hacking to<br>
	   result in a legal battle if it is not performed properly. It is also possible for<br>
	   the ethical hacker to commit error to the point that the orginization's profitab-<br>
	   -ility is negativley affected.</p>
	   
	<p>In such a case, the orginization could sue the eithical hacker for failing to per-<br>
	   -form properly. The ethical hacker could be at legal risk if proper care and prec-<br>
	   -autionare are not seriously taken. To address these legal issues, it is imperati-<br>
	   -ve for the ethical hacker to always perform his job defensively to minimize compr-<br>
	   -mising the client's system or network.</p><br>
